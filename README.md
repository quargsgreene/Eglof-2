Eglof is a filter plugin that allows for the choosing of up to 100 peaks or cuts. The peaks correspond to values in the chosen column of an uploaded CSV file. 
Eglof is currently available in the following formats:
* VST3 (MacOS, Windows, Linux)
* AU (MacOS)
* AAX (coming soon!)

## Instructions for Use
Make sure you have selected stereo input. Click on the "Click to choose a CSV" button and choose a CSV file from your device. Once you have chosen a CSV file, select one of its columns from the dropdown menu. You can adjust the factor by which the gains of the peaks are scaled to a factor betweek -6dB and +6dB using the slider. Adjust the slider slowly when increasing the gain or you may experience unexpected clipping!
